_Under development_

[Here's what's planned for 1.0](https://github.com/thektan/taste/milestone/2)

## Development

### Environment

We are using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Deploying

To start the app, go into the `node` directory and run:

```
yarn start
```

To watch for css changes, open a new terminal and run:

```
yarn watch-css
```

Prettier formatting is automatically run on every commit.
